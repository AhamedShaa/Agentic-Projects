At each level, the algorithm assigns the label of the new region based on a majority vote of points within it. The binary splitting method is efficient, cutting the number of options by approximately half with each question asked. In machine learning implementations of decision trees, the questions usually take the form of axis-aligned splits in the data, where each node in the tree divides the data into two groups using a cutoff.'"

Make sure you have imported Matplotlib and any other necessary libraries.\\n2. Generate or load your data that you want to plot in the histogram.\\n3. Use the plt.hist() function to plot the histogram. For example:\\n   ```\\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n   import numpy as np\\n   \\n   data = np.random.randn(1000)  # Example data generation\\n   plt.hist(data)\\n   ```\\n4.
